# RestAssuredTrelloBoardWorkflow

This is a RestAssured API Testing project for TrelloBoard.
Tools used-Java,Eclipse,TestNG, Maven
HTTP method used-GET,PUT,POST,DELETE
It's a workflow of Creating Board, Adding List, Adding Cards, Moving Cards from one List to another.
And then Deleting Board.
I have used my own Key and Token . If someone wants to run they have to make their own account in Trello Board , generate Token and replace Key and Token by their owns. 
Can add thread.sleep(3000)in each test like the way I have used to see the functioning of it side by side in Trello Board.
